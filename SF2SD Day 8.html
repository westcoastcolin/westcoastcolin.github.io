<p>
A quick trip to the beach to greet the morning sun saw me out of my tent and ready to carpe that diem! I was quick to pack and get on the road, anxious for some food to fill the nutritional gap that comes with a missed meal on tour.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Though Southern California beaches are out of this world, the proximity to Highway 1/101 and the Amtrak rails often mean that they are noisy and crowded. Several times over the next week I would be awoken by a train screaming over the tracks in the middle of the night. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
As I recall in my journal, ‘I barely remember the first 12 or so miles to UCSB. Mostly sunny and flat on 101 right by the ocean. It went quick!’ At times road cycling can be incredibly meditative, as it was this morning. There are parts of days, sometimes hours long, that just seem to happen without any effort, almost as if they didn’t even happen. It’s a peculiar sensation, but I believe that it is a product of a paradox: a completely absent mind derived from intense focus on the task at hand. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Whatever may be happening during these moments, they leave me present-minded, energized, and further south than where I started!
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
After tacos and a visit to UCSB, I hopped onto Santa Barbara’s web of bicycle paths. Another flat tire had me a little frustrated, so I went to Santa Barbara Bob’s bicycle shop just west of town to replace my worn back tire and replace the tube. The kind folks at the store also lent me a rag and degreaser for cleaning up my drivetrain. Then, back on the road, I used my intuition to find the coast again and ride into town.
</p>
<br>
<p>
First I passed through the spectacular Hope Ranch, where millionaires perch their estates on the edge of the ocean. This beautiful section brought me to Cliff Drive on the west end of Santa Barbara. Finding a bike path, I rode it into town for a quick stop at Stern’s Wharf. Here I was able to rest a moment with smile, reflecting on how far I had already come!
</p>
<br>
<p>
Later, I met with Reed on the road and we cycled together into Carpinteria. A shorter day with an early start meant that we had a large portion of the afternoon to get groceries, enjoy the sand, and even take a dip in “the world’s safest swimming beach.” Of course, some cold beers were on the menu too!
