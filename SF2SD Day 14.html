    Just plugging in the music and grinding was the key today, without pain and muscle aches I was able to comfortably (and graciously) sit, allowing me to focus.

<p>
At 6:00 AM when I pushed off, I knew I was in for a big day. Still dark and silent before the steady masses of Los Angeles commuters filled the streets, I was very glad to have left early. My goal was Doheny State Beach, about 75 miles to the south.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The west coast is best suited for sunset, when we get to watch the colorful sun wane behind the waves. Still, the peaceful riding along the beach as the city slept were joyous moments of stillness to cycle through. Today, I really grooved.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Able to sit comfortably on my bicycle from mile one was more than a relief. Instead of the instant suffering of saddle sores on mile one, for the first time in the trip I felt like I was sat on a cushion. This physical relief also had huge benefits for my mind, allowing me to ease into a steady zone where mile after mile went by.
</p>

Before long I was celebrating 50 miles into Huntington Beach with an apple and a granola bar. I was into Orange County, and would have some of California’s most famous beaches this afternoon. This afternoon’s riding was easy, straightforward, and flat. A joy to experience this part of the coast.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Upon arriving at Doheny State Beach, I unfortunately learned that they did not offer hiker-biker sites any longer, and the cheapest sites were $40. As a guy on a budget who had all afternoon, that was an invitation to continue riding to San Clemente State Beach, about 8 miles south. 
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
On this day I could have ridden 120 miles, I felt. Everything physically and mentally was solid, which was good news because upon arriving at San Clemente SB I was told that I had to bike an additional couple miles to a further camp site, called the San Mateo Campground. Although I was a little annoyed not to be camping on the beach, this San Mateo spot had its own trail to the coast which I would end up enjoying.
</p>
<br>
<p>
First, though, I had to set up my tent in what seemed to be a hurricane. Nobody was around to witness, but I’d like to let you all enjoy the mental image of Colin chasing a half set-up tent around camp… multiple times. After that battle, I was free to enjoy another sunset and gear up for the next day.
