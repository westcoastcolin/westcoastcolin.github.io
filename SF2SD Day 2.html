  Day 2: Half Moon Bay to New Brighton State Beach, Capitola

    I stopped at the Pigeon Point Lighthouse as well as Natural Bridges State Beach before riding into Santa Cruz via a bike path that sometimes gave the Giant Dipper a run for its money.

<p>
Morning fog encouraged me to stay snuggled up in my sleeping bag to stay warm, so I didn’t get going until 10:30. No worries though! On a bicycle trip, you have all day. I watched the waves and chatted with my neighbors until I was convinced I should get going.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This ride to New Brighton State Beach was one of the best I’ve experienced along the entire coast. All day long the roads and bike paths hugged the bending coastline, a true joy to experience during California’s prime fall weather. Combine sunny skies with a steady tailwind and these views, and the miles flew by.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Along the way I met Keith “Tree” Barry, a tangential fifth member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers who is lifelong friends with the famous bassist and one of the band’s founding members, Flea. Tree was a joy to talk to, and I enjoyed his company during the miles we shared. Having biked the majority of the Pacific Coast over 20 times, Tree was now bringing less gear than he used to as a younger man, opting to stay in hotels rather than camp each night.
</p>
<br>
<p>
At age 54, I can’t blame the guy. A part of him felt like he wasn’t “earning” it like he used to, but in the end we both agreed that he was out here doing it still, and that’s all that really matters. This fresh perspective was strong insight into my own motivations and struggles behind this ride.
</p>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
With pit stops at Pigeon Point lighthouse, Natural Bridges State Beach, and the famous Santa Cruz Boardwalk, there was plenty to see on these 64 miles! Sadly, the Boardwalk’s rides were closed so I couldn’t hop onto the Giant Dipper as I had hoped. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, I pushed through the last few miles to Capitola, where I picked up a campsite and shower for $6. The campsite, while filled with RVs, was still fantastic. The hiker biker area is almost cliffside, though it’s a little walk down to the beach. After setting up camp I took a quick ride to AJ’s Mart up the road for groceries and a cold beer to celebrate a great day!
</p>
<br>
<p>
At camp when I returned there was a Frenchman, Christian, who was biking around the coast sightseeing and visiting friends. Christian, an English teacher, had a great sense of humor, love of life, and sense of humor. He got along great with myself and the two German guys who were hitchhiking around North America and had met just that morning. It seems that wherever one travels, you are bound to run into German guys. They're always great - really adventurous people!
</p>
<br>
<p>
Together we laughed and enjoyed the company well into the next morning, where eventually we had to part ways. I would, however, run into JD (one of the Germans) and Tree again later!
