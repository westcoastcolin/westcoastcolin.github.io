  Bicycle Tour Data

All of this data was self-collected using the odometer on my bicycle. Looking back, I wish I had more to compile! Maybe Strava will be a future option.

From my experiences on self-supported tours, 40-50 miles averaged per day gives the best blend of exercise and relaxation. Of course due to available campsites, climates, time constraints, and almost anything else you might imagine, miles ridden on a given day can vary quite a bit.

Day to day it looks like there was some variability in my moving speed, particularly in the first week as my body adapted. Over time my average pace increased slightly as I gained fitness, giving me hope that if I ever go on a long enough tour I might start averaging 30 MPH <i class="em em-stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye"></i>

Here I analyzed my biking pace in relation to how many miles I biked each day. While this is a small sample overall, there is a pretty clear indication of a gut feeling I always had: I get amped for the big days and ride much harder when there are more miles to complete. On the shorter days the data suggests that I pedal at a more leisurely pace.

On the Journey of Hope North Route, my team and I frequently lamented the fact that there always seems to be a hill to lodging on our daily route. While I will look into that trip soon, for this trip our theory did not hold true: there were more days without a hill to lodging than the opposite. Considering most nights I was camped just feet away from the beach, there were actually still more hills than I anticipated.
