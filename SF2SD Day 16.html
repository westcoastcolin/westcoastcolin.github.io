<div class="story">

<p>
This last night of sleep in my tent proved to be far from my best. This campsite is right on 101 and the train tracks, so traffic and freight kept me awake.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The beautiful ocean view in the morning was really effective in brightening up my mood. I even took the liberty of a morning shower, possibly the hottest one I’ve ever had at a state park! These are both very redeeming qualities to a night with little sleep.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I only had to make it about 25 miles to where I was staying the night in San Diego, so at about 10 AM I packed up for the last time. A few morning hills brought me away from the coast and more inland, as I traced a path to my friend Nick’s house. 
</p>
<br>

<a href="https://imgur.com/KkXkCk8.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="A rare and awesome encounter with this man!"><img src="https://imgur.com/KkXkCk8.jpg"></a>
<br> <br> <br>

<p>
Without much trouble I soon arrived and was welcomed by my host and someone I look up to very much. After serving as Project Manager on my Journey of Hope team, Nick joined the Navy after several attempts. His perseverance, discipline, and dedication is paying off - Nick has been promoted up to Navigator of a US Battleship. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Since he had to go back to work in the afternoon for a while, I dropped BOB off in his garage, and rode my bicycle further into San Diego! With about 40 pounds of gear taken off, the first mile or two on the bike were a strange sensation. Akin perhaps to moving from one kind of boat to another, the change in balance and mechanics was enjoyably bemusing. Soon, I was used to it and taking advantage of my lighter ride to fly up some bigger hills.
</p>
<br>
<p>
These hills brought me to lunch, which was of course Mexican food. Upon the recommendation of a friend, Dylan, I hit up El Cuervo on Washington Street to satisfy my hunger. A fabulous fish taco was paired with a slow-cooked chicken burrito. While it was a ton of food, there is never enough to have on a bicycle tour! One only has to be careful not to continue eating like this after your trip is done. El Cuervo had a friendly feel, delicious and fresh food, and was very nicely priced. While I have a lot more of San Diego to try out, I would definitely stop here again!
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
Once I was satisfied, I continued my ride into Balboa Park, San Diego’s largest park. Tempted by a trip to the zoo, I opted instead to continue my scenic tour of the parks gardens, buildings, and more. This tour ended near downtown, where I zipped around to find a suitable finish line. After some photos and an inner moment of celebration, I turned around and headed back to lodging.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nick, his wife Jeannine, his doggy Pax, and I enjoyed a terrific barbeque with chicken, asparagus, salad, and dutch apple pie topped with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Later, completely satisfied, I would go to bed. After roughly 5,400 miles and three months of my life cycling, I had made it both West-East and North-South across the United States of America.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The next day, I would ride downtown with my trailer once more to a hotel. A day spent sightseeing (by bicycle) and tasting food would finish with a sunset by the bay and a night out in Little Italy with my old friend Alia from camp! Following this, I rode my bicycle about two blocks to the Amtrak station, where I packed up my ride and headed north.

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
Bicycle tours are surprising, strenuous, and a challenge every day. However, they are in my mind one of the most unique and beautiful ways to travel, with every challenge reaping a tremendous reward. It feels very good to see the world by traveling slowly and sustainably, and I would be happy to help others try it out. Thanks for reading my story.
