I slept without a rainfly, enjoying the warm October air throughout the night. The full moon traced its way over the sky, at times blocked by the massive trees protecting us. Whenever I woke up, I was able to check the moon to approximate the time. Always blissfully pleased that I had more time to sleep, the ocean waves and bird songs would serve as a caring lullaby until the morning.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When it was time to rise and shine, it was hard to contain my excitement. It was Day 10 - LA day! Of course, it was a day like any other on tour in the end, but it is an important milestone for anyone hoping to make it down the entire coast.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Reed and I rode out of Sycamore Grove together, and soon we were almost into Malibu. On the west edge of town is Neptune’s Net, a seafood shack recommended to me by my cousin Ian. Taking his advice, we ate some clam chowder and calamari as a second breakfast. Definitely a delicious stop! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
At this time I said bye to Reed and rode along alone. So is the manner of friendships on tour. For a while we seriously pondered going for Baja together, but in the end neither of us would go. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Soon, I was into Malibu. As you enter, cars line the land and surfers breach the beach. The long, low, waves rolled along - as did I. The impressive coastal houses stand on stilts, just over the water. These were fun to admire, but overall I was surprised by the busy feel of Malibu - too many cars on the road made for stressful riding. Perhaps I chose the wrong time.
</p>

<p>
On the other end of town, my spirits were high. I met a fellow bicycle tourist, Timon, a Dutch lad who had cycled down from Alaska. Timon (@timondubbeling on Insta, timononhisbike.wordpress.com) was planning on going to Panama, perhaps further! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
We shared some stories and pedaled into Santa Monica together. Here, the winding bike path was literally a part of the beach, encouraging sand to spill onto it at any time. Still, it meandered towards that famous pier, in front of colorful beachfront homes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The pier was poppin. Lots of wild things to see, for those who haven’t been, include: people with pigeon-feeding fetishes, carnival rides, possibly(?) intentionally poor musical performances, and much more. A decent tourist trap, similar to Fisherman’s Wharf in SF. Soon, it was time to split.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I attempted to navigate a questionably functional bike network through Santa Monica and West LA, with much confusion. Luckily our overlords Google had my back with their maps. Finally, with some patience, I made it to Ian’s place. Like a good cousin should, he had cold beer waiting!
