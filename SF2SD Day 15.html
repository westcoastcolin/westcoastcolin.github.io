With just 35 miles on the schedule today, at this point it was a joy ride.  The sandy shores were soon to be no more, so I made a point to soak this one in. By the end of the day, I was feeling yesterday’s 90 miles and was happy to be off the bike.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Passing south via the coast and US Camp Pendleton made up the first part of the day. Some fantastic bike paths around this area were far removed from any busy roads, allowing for some carefree stretches by the beach. These paths afforded views of the golden hills and rounded mountains of the region.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I stopped for lunch in Oceanside for a personal picnic. I had sandwiches made of turkey, brie, hummus, and avocado. Yes please! I set up so close to the ocean that occasionally I’d get hit with a little saltwater spray, though it wouldn’t wipe the smile off my face today.
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
Cruising along in the afternoon brought me to Carlsbad, and eventually Encinitas where I spent the night at San Elijo State Beach. I couldn’t check in right away, so after a beer at the local watering hole I backtracked a short mile or so to the Shwami’s Meditation Center. This is a beautiful retreat area, with free access to its coastal gardens. Having taken up meditation during this trip and with the plan to continue after, this afforded me a neat opportunity to see what kinds of other people meditation attracts.
</p>
<br>
<p>
What I was happy to see is that it looks like all sorts of people were visiting the gardens and practicing this day. There were folks tall and short, dressed for the office and casually, male, female, whatever. All kinds of people meditate, looking to find presence and stillness in this often crazy world! 
</p>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
Finally, I went back to camp to set up my tent and enjoy the beach. Before sunset I took a quick trip to Besta Wan’s Pizza House across the street, my second time after a prior visit with the fine, taco-loving, Watson family. Besta Wan’s, while it brings visitors in for the pizza, brings the locals in for the fish tacos.
</p>
<br>
<p>
For anyone in Encinitas, get your hands on some of these massive fish tacos if you can. They are fried, flaky, and tasty. While I haven't grown up eating lots of fish tacos, these are some of my favorites.
</p>
<br>
<p>
With a full stomach I enjoyed a final swim in the water, feeling much more ocean warmth than I had up in Half Moon Bay just two weeks before. Last, I retired to my tent, where for the second night in a row I was the only hiker or biker to claim a site at this beach.
