Wow, I am pooped. Lots of headwinds and busy roads, with a few steep hills (with the best for last - [the hill] to lodging) that really drained me on this Day Three.

<div class="story">

<p>
After a while, I knew my time off the bicycle would catch up with me. While riding used to be a major part of my life, I had taken a break of nearly two years from long days on the saddle. Although the 44 miles I rode is not exceptionally long by my past standards, one's body needs to adapt to the challenge of the hours sitting on the bicycle, the muscle fatigue, the changing metabolic needs of your body, and the general lack of comfort that come with exposure to the elements and sleeping on the ground instead of in a bed. Of course, it didn't help to be hauling about 40 pounds of gear, too.
</p>
<br>
<p>
So while my spirits were still high, my body was weaker today. Battling busy roads with no shoulders and droves of trucks had me hoping to get the job done. Coastal views from the first two days were traded for artichoke and strawberry farms. The latter graced the day with fruity fragrances as I pedaled by, a pleasure in an otherwise tougher day for me. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
After overcoming my first flat tire (this one on BOB, the trailer) and finding my way into downtown Monterey, I stopped at Bay Bikes downtown to grab a new tube and gather some intel regarding the Big Sur closures which were threatening my plans for the next couple days. Afterwards, just around the block I savored some incredible tacos at Papa Chano’s. This meal made every tough bit of the day worth it. 
</p>

<p>
As a Californian, I feel that it is my heritage and life goal to experience the most out of my state’s Mexican food. Not only am I always down for tacos, but being on a bicycle all day allows for both increased appetite and access to tacos on the road. This trip was a huge chance for me to explore more of this mundo mexicano, and I tried to take every chance I could to savor my favorite flavors. Papa Chano’s amazed me with their pollo asado, fresh salsa and toppings, and authentic taqueria ambience. While they aren’t the cheapest tacos around, these are downright quality and are totally reasonably priced for what you get. This is a must-stop for anyone passing through Monterey with an appetite.

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
An unwritten rule of bicycle tours is that there is <a href="SF2SD Statistics.html">always a hill to lodging</a>, and this day was no exception. A steep climb, loaded down with groceries and weary after three days riding, pushed my legs to the limit as I ascended above Monterey to Vets Memorial Campground. This small, wooded park stood out to me for its community. The hiker/biker site had several local/vagabond types staying here, so I wasn't sure what I could expect from the evening. The reality is that what I found here was that despite this community’s transient nature, a culture of sharing and family exists between the more regular habitants and those just passing by. I was grateful to share stories with traveling Californians and Czech Republicans alike. Early, around 8:30, I could stay up no longer.
