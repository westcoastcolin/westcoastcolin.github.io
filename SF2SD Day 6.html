<div class="story">
<p>
Hallie and I made a quick start in the morning, both excited for another day! This was the end of Big Sur, and we were now into the heart of the central coast. First, we snuck a quick look back as the morning light illuminated the Mud Creek Slide, the largest in California history! Image is below, but you can obviously see some better photos elsewhere online.
</p>
<br>
<p>
A few morning hills warmed the legs as we quickly hit San Luis Obispo County. Suddenly, the mountains waned away, and our windy road straightened out into long, flat, stretches of road on the beach. I soaked this in all the way to San Simeon, where I gratefully sat down with Hallie for some lunch. Celebrating our conquering of Big Sur together, we had BBQ sandwiches and beers to toast the occasion. Well earned, those!
</p>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
After that, I had to part ways with my friend. She and I were on different schedules, so I took off. Our generous lunch really refueled my body after slightly shorting myself on supplies in Big Sur, and I used this energy to fly!
</p>
<br>
<p>
The miles passed easily along the coast as I hit Cambria, Cayucos, and Morro Bay, spotting elephant seals along the way. The weather was great, my stomach was full, and the scenery was special. California, my beautiful home!
</p>
<br>
<a href="https://imgur.com/lLr0p33.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Pretty ideal part of the world. Didn't actually mean to go into SLO, but my legs took me there."><img src="https://imgur.com/lLr0p33.jpg"></a>
<br><br><br>
<p>
While now I wish I had a chance to spend a night in Morro Bay, the offer of a bed, hot shower, and laundry at a friendâ€™s house near Pismo Beach inspired me to keep pushing. Determined, I rode inland through San Luis Obispo, before following bike paths along 101 to Pismo, and eventually after a brief rest on the beach to Arroyo Grande. Looking down at my odometer, I realized that today had been 85 miles.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This bicycle trip was individual in its nature, but individuals are products of their communities. Today I felt grateful for those helping me through this journey - the friends I could ride with, those providing me lodging and a hot meal (crab cake tacos, anyone?!), and everyone at home sending warm wishes.
