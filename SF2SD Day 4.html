I woke up with tired legs but an energized mind. The only preoccupations I carried were regarding picking up enough supplies to last for Big Sur and encroaching upon California’s largest recorded landslide. A Safeway in Carmel-by-the-Sea proved to be a good spot to gather inventory before I rejoined Highway 1.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Being a Saturday, the road was busy along the coast for several miles after town. Quickly, I discovered why. Although I grew up in the Bay Area, I had never had the opportunity to visit this section of our coast. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="epic">
<strong>It is epic.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Highway 1 really shouldn’t exist for this stretch of the coast. In Big Sur you really feel like you’re on the edge of the entire continent. Of course, you are, but the magnitude of the cliffs and mountains contrasted against the aqua waters tiding to and fro are remarkable. The road has for now been etched out of this land, but two road-blocking landslides this spring reminded California that no battle against Earth is definitively won.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Along the way I was filled with joy to make a friend, Hallie! This girl kicks so much ass that she biked from Vancouver, BC, to the border, solo. Together, we would become partners in crime.
</p>
<br>
<p>
After several miles winding over the famous coastline (sometimes aided by terrific tailwinds!) I reached a valley just so slightly inland, where redwood trees returned and the songs of birds replaced the crashing of waves. I had made it to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
</p>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
I had the afternoon to enjoy a hot shower, do some laundry, and scout out the next couple days. Once Hallie arrived we shared stories, many milanos, and even more laughs. Eventually, a dinner of pasta and chicken sausage, steamed veggies, and the arrival of a few other cyclists would round out a great day!
