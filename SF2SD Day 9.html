With a schedule to keep so that I could hit LA by Friday, I regretfully biked out of Carpinteria this morning. To my total surprise, a massive operation was underway to throw a party in honor of the great avocado. Apparently they even have <a href="https://avofest.com/">the world's largest vat of guacamole.</a> Someday, I will return for the Avocado Festival! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Pacific Coast bike path south of Carpinteria is phenomenal, and the entire day would turn out to be a joy. For miles I rode this path, which had a fence to keep cyclists from falling into the ocean. Out in the sun, I was loving life!
</p>
<br>
<p>
Still, by the time I got to Ventura my body felt depleted of energy. The sun was sapping my strength despite the inspiring surroundings. Frozen yogurt, shade, and a lunch in town went a long way towards giving me the boost I needed to take on the afternoon.
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
The next couple hours brought the trail inland past farms. There were beautiful red bell peppers lining the road, and fruit stands selling tasty produce. It was here in Oxnard that I noticed how barren the mountains had become - the land was transitioning to desert. Eventually, the route took a turn past NAS Point Mugu, a naval base. Here on display were some retired fighter jets, missiles, and rockets, which made my inner child soar with delight! They even had an F-14 Tomcat, my jet fighter of choice from a very young age.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The next stretch of the coast was unique to date - barren beaches bordered by sheer, brown, cliffs, and a road somehow laid in between. This section got me itching for Baja California, a tour to come soon. 
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>
<p>
Cruising along, I reached Sycamore Grove of Point Mugu State Park. Having no expectations for this campsite, I was blown away by the beauty of little Sycamore Grove. Nestled into a valley perpendicular to the coast, it was an oasis of trees, plants, and cooler temperatures. The hiker biker site was far removed from the rest of the sites, allowing Reed and I to spread out and enjoy our home for the evening.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Sunset walks on the beach and a delicious shared dinner of pasta, sausage, and veggies, led to a very happy conclusion of Day 9.
