  Days 11-13: Resting and Exploring Los Angeles

    I want to grow, and that can only come through perfecting a positive mindset and really making the most out of each day. That is what the bike tour forces me to do, which is probably why these are the days when my heart is most content.

<p>
These days were filled with rest, with a side of tacos and nightlife! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Having ridden ten days straight to make it to LA in time for the weekend, I wouldn’t have had it any other way. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
It was great catching up with my cousin Ian, finally getting the chance to see his store, LA Cloud Supply. Further, having grown up in LA, Ian was the perfect guy to show me the best spots in town to eat. Of course, this meant a continuation of the California taco tour.
</p>
<br>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
Between Ian and his group of friends, and perhaps much more of Los Angeles, the tacos in town to try are at <a href="http://www.leostacostruck.com/#/">Leo’s Taco Truck</a>. The specialty is the shawarma-grilled al pastor pork tacos, topped with a hunk of pineapple, for $1.50 each. The shawarma, as you can see in my photo, was larger than the torso of the men serving them! Not only was it a spectacle, but it was also absolutely delicious. Best al pastor tacos in the game!
</p>
<br>
<p>
I also had the chance to visit with some other friends in town, whom I was grateful to see. I even treated myself to a massage, hoping to heal the general aches and pains that develop on the bike. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Overall, it was great to relax, reload on some lost calories, and gear up for the final leg to San Diego! There are no public campsites in LA, so I was due for a big one on Day 14.
