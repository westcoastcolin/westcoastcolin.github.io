<p>
  Today's ride began where all great bike tours begin and end - the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  In the past, this bridge has served my friends and I as the beginning of the North Route for the Journey of Hope, a cross-country cycling trip to raise funds and awareness for <a href= "http://www.abilityexperience.org/journeyofhope.aspx">The Ability Experience</a>, a non-profit that raises funds and awareness for people with disabilities. Additionally, my last trip (from Seattle to San Francisco) in 2015 finished here.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  After taking some photos with my friends J and Brian, it was time to go! A huge adrenaline rush hit me as I rode out of the parking lot. I tried to sustain and relish that emotional high for as long as possible to gather momentum through The City. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Biking through San Francisco was fantastic. Beginning with the familiarity of my home city allowed me to focus on spinning my pedals and enjoying the surroundings, as I cruised past Baker Beach and down 25th Avenue to Golden Gate Park. J and Brian took some photos along the way, which will hopefully soon make it into the album below!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  The ride through GG Park and past Ocean Beach amped me up for the rest of the day, helping me through some headwinds and over some hills as I rode out of SF and Daly City, and towards Pacifica. A pause to take in the endless ocean views and blue skies at Devil’s slide, where a couple bicycle tourists I met were resting to whale watch during today's leg of their honeymoon. 
</p>

<br> <br> <br>

<p>
After this point, the ride was a breeze. Despite that, due to my late morning start it was mid-afternoon by the time I got to Barbara’s Fish Trap, a must-stop for seafood in Half Moon Bay. My parents and the family dogs, Saeby and Belle, met me there for a late lunch, where we had the irresistible fish and chips along with a tasty ceviche.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Stomach full and yearning to kick off my shoes, I enjoyed the California Coastal Route bicycle path along the coast until I reached Half Moon Bay State Beach. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
While the 33 miles on Day One were not the most intimidating I would face, the emotions and logistics of beginning the trip and getting out of San Francisco meant that I was ready to settle down and recharge!
</p>
<br>
<p>
For $8 I got a hiker/biker campsite within 100 feet of the sand, and a warm shower. Joined once again by my folks and dogs for a vibrant sunset, I was excited and grateful to know that another two weeks of enjoying the California coast was on its way!
